<h2>What is The Communication Collaborative?</h2>
The Communication Collaborative is a research group in solidarity with The Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and those with speech, language and voice impairments living in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
We are people who stutter (PWS), members of provincial government, members of the public, educators, speech-language pathologists, academic researchers, university students, mental health professionals, disability advocates, and NLSA members.
For more information about the NLSA - which is dedicated to advocacy and support for people who stutter - please visit their <a href="http://nlstuttering.ca">website</a>.

Our collaborators will continue to: <br>
<br>
1. learn about stuttering research and how it could be used for NLSA advocacy
2. implement ways to leverage support from public and private agencies
3. participate in research (e.g. to study / recognize deficits in the provinceâ€™s programs and services for PWS)
4. promote cross-discipline research at Memorial University
5. provide learning experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students attending Memorial, and MUN alumni (e.g. speech-language pathology students who are attending graduate schools out of province).
