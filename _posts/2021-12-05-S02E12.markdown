On today's episode, we are welcoming Mary Wood!

Mary is a person who stutters and has had lots of experiences throughout her life to share with us on this topic! Mary talks about her experiences in speech therapy, and her experiences in support groups. All three discuss the importance of support group for people who stutter. Mary gives advice for future clinicians, as well as the future generation of people who stutter. Throughout the episode, Mary offers wisdom and provides inspiration and motivation in her stories and experiences!  

Mary first attended a conference for PWS in Ottawa in 1993 where she presented a workshop on self esteem.  After stuttering for over 50 years, she had discovered information on the fear of rejection and how it showed up in her life.  Her journey was changing from fluency to self acceptance.  Since that first conference in 1993, Mary has spoken at CSA, NSA, and ISA conferences in Canada, the United States, Europe and Great Britain.  In 2005, she was ordained as a Unity minister, a lesson that taught her you never know whatâ€™s around the next corner.
