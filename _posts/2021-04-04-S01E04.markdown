On today's episode we hear from Liz Fagan!

Liz is a musician, a writer for Le Gaboteur and is very involved in the French community of NL. With a background in linguistics, Liz says their love of sociolinguists and writing/translating music are their favorite ways to bring audiences together! Liz shares their experiences as a PWS, how having a stutter has influenced a passion and interest in working with languages, and talks about their journey of accepting their stutter.
