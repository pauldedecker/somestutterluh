Tom Scharstein is a person who stutters and an entrepreneur from South Florida, USA. Taking full advantage of the changing times with the new dependence on virtual connection, he and a team of innovators created the World Stuttering Network (WSN) in 2020. The mission of the WSN is to create a discussion among the world's stuttering support leaders to share helpful information & best practices to provide the best help for people who stutter globally. The WSN hosts the annual 'StutterFEST!', a 24-hour celebration of the world stuttering community. Guests and organizations from around the world present on multiple virtual stages throughout the day, allowing attendees from every time zone to attend.

Tom's life journey with stuttering has included over 25 years in stuttering support, mostly as a support group leader. 3 out of his 4 household family members stutter, which makes the family dynamic very interesting, as each person stutters & deals with their stutter differently.

Lisa & Tom are avid outdoor enthusiasts, and are often found paddling around Florida on the weekends.

This episode airs on Sunday morning, August 28, at 9am Newfoundland Time.
