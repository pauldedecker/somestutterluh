Today we are chatting with George Shields!

George Shields speaks with us about his involvement with the Speech and Stuttering Institute and Harmonize for Speech. The Harmonize For Speech fund was established in 1977 as the fund-raising project of the Ontario District Association of Chapters, SPEBSQSA, commonly known as the Barbershop Harmony Society. George shares what has inspired his advocacy work and chats with Greg and Katelyn about the importance of music and how it works in treatment. He gives advice for Katelyn and other future SLP students, as well as for those interested in promoting awareness and supporting people who stutter.
