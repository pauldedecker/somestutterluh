On today's episode we welcome Brent Foote!

Brent is a PWS and has recently become heavily involved with the NLSA! We chat with Brent about his involvement with the NLSA support group and hear his experiences and perspectives as a PWS. Brent shares stories about growing up with a stutter and talks about how his stutter has affected both social life and work life. He shares his love of sports and hockey, and talks about how those passions helped him gain confidence. Brent shares some great advice for PWS, for SLPs, and for the public and he also asks both Greg and Katelyn some great questions!
