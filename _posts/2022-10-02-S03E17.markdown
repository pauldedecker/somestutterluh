In SSL! episode (S3:E17) Greg speaks with Steven Hiscock. Steven works with the Burgeo Broadcasting Station. Growing up in Burgeo, NL he never imagined he would become an on-camera personality. As a child Steven stuttered; so interviewing people was not a career path he envisioned at all. He was bullied and made fun of a lot. Over time Steven has learned a few tricks to help manage his stutter. Steven says that it's all about your breathing when you talk and along with a few more tricks.

There is a great article [about Steven](https://www.saltwire.com/newfoundland-labrador/news/a-stutterer-no-more-burgeo-newscaster-earning-accolades-for-talking-abilities-308791/) published in SALTWIRE NL by Rosalyn Roy Posted: May 7, 2019.
