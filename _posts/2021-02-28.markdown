Today, Greg and Katelyn chat with Kim Lawlor!
Kim is a Speech-Language Pathologist in Newfoundland. Kim chats with us about the Fluency Plus program, an intensive program used by SLPs in the treatment of stuttering. We discuss the 17 SLPs in Newfoundland who have recently completed the Fluency Plus training, and how this program can be used in the effective treatment of people who stutter in the province. Kim also talks about the importance of addressing the emotional component, in addition to fluency enhancing skills, in stuttering therapy and gives her thoughts on the collaboration between other SLPs, counsellors, psychologists, teachers, etc... Finally, Kim discusses some of her experiences working as an SLP and talks about some of the most rewarding aspects of the profession!
