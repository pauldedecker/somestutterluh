In our first episode of season 3, Greg speaks to Casey Dumaresq about his most fluent and severe phases of stuttering, the exact moment when he felt that he had a speaking challenge for the first time, and why he was not diagnosed with a fluency disorder. He also discusses careers that a person who stutters might pursue. All this and much more!

Casey Dumaresq is a gay person who stutters and a Speech-Language Pathologist. Casey grew up in rural New Brunswick, and went to graduate school in Halifax. He now lives in Toronto with his husband. Casey leads a stuttering support group in downtown Toronto (currently on pause due to the Covid-19 pandemic), and previously served on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Stuttering Association. These days, Casey finds himself in a mostly-fluent phase of life, and looks forward to discussing his current place in the stuttering community.
