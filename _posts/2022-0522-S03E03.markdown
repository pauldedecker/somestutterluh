What is a linguist? We know it has something to do with languages, right? Well, Dr. Jesse Harris is one and in this episode he explains what he does. (Spoiler! His research involves experiments that track people’s eyes while they read!) As a linguist who stutters, he views stuttering as "a normal part of the speech continuum". Tune in to learn more about Jesse’s research and personal experiences at both ends of this continuum!

Dr. Jesse Harris is an associate professor at [UCLA in the Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/jesse-harris/), and advises the [UCLA Language Processing Lab](http://processing.linguistics.ucla.edu/). He investigates how the brain figures out meaning when engaged in communication. As a person who stutters, he’s proud to serve on the Board of Directors of [My Speech](https://myspeechapp.org/), a non-profit dedicated to facilitating access to high-quality, client-centered speech therapy to people in underserved communities, as well as providing resources on disability rights for students who stutter and education for speech-language pathologists in training.

Enjoy their conversation.
