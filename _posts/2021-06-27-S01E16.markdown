Today, Greg and Katelyn are chatting with April Kennedy.

April is the parent of a person who stutters, and, having no previous knowledge or background with stuttering, April shares her experiences and everything she learned as a parent. She shares some of the mistakes she made and opens up about the feelings of guilt that come to parents of PWS. She shares when and how she began to learn more about stuttering, and how that changed the way she reacted and parented her son. April chats about the challenges of supporting someone who stutters and the ways in which she has sought support, while also explaining ways that support and resources could (and should) be made more easily accessible for parents of children who stutter. Finally, April shares about her experiences in the NLSA support group and how that has helped change her perspective of stuttering and people who stutter. She gives advice and encourages other parents of PWS to learn about stuttering and seek out support wherever available.
