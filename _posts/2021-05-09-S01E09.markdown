In today's episode we interview Jon Garcin!

Jon is a person who stutters, a speech-language pathologist, and member of the NLSA. Jon has been a big supporter of this podcast and other NLSA projects in Newfoundland for many years! Jon speaks not only about his experiences as a person who stutters, but also as an SLP treating those who happen to stutter. Jon discusses his experiences of anxiety and acceptance as a PWS and also shares how being a person who stutters has impacted and influenced him in his education, career and relationships. Jon also shares his experiences as an SLP working virtually throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, how he supports both students and parents during treatment, and his experience with the Fluency Plus program. As well, all three have some thought-provoking conversations about what it means and how it feels to be "normal" or to live without anxiety associated with communication.
