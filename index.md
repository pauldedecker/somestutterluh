<h2>About the name</h2>
The name <em>Some Stutter, Luh!</em> is a play on words and reflects the podcast’s origin in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br>
The word “some” can mean an indefinite number of people, or it can intensify the meaning of a noun, and “Luh” is a Newfoundland expression that draws attention to the phrase being said, much like the word “hey.”<br>
As a result, the title <em>Some Stutter, Luh!</em> can be interpreted as either “Hey, some people stutter!” or “Hey, that’s some stutter!”
