<h2>What is The Communication Collaborative?</h2>
The Communication Collaborative (previously known as the NLSA COLLABORATIVE) is a research group in solidarity with The Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and those with speech, language and voice impairments living in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
We are people who stutter (PWS), members of provincial government, members of the public, educators, speech-language pathologists, academic researchers, university students, mental health professionals, disability advocates, and NLSA members.
For more information about the NLSA - which is dedicated to advocacy and support for people who stutter - please visit their <a href="nlstuttering.ca">website</a>.
